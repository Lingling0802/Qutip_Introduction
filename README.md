# Qutip_Introduction
Introduction for python Quantum Toolbox 'Qutip'

QuTiP: Python package for calculations and numerical simulations of quantum systems

The notebook gave some examples about States and Operators in Qutip.

Dynamic Evolution of the System Steps:
* Set system parameter
* Build Hamiltonian and collapse operators
* Solve master equation
* Run steady state Solver
* Visualize the results
